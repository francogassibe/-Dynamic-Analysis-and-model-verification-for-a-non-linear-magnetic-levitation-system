# Introduction to MagneticVibrations

In this proyect we found a model to describe a magnetic levitation system
We refear to two magnets continuously repelling each other in vertical position 

To better understand the system you can see a video of a dynamic response in the test.MP4 video

We analysed the different responses to the diferent values for the physical parameters as well as making a fequency analysis and linearization. We made a test in a lab with a laser to mesure the position of the levitating magnet to be able to validate the modle.

the main project is in 'Proyecto_Vibratoria_Principal' in case you want to run it
