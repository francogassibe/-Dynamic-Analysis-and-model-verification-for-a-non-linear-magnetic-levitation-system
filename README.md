# MagneticVibrations

In this proyect we found a model to describe a magnetic levitation system 
We analysed the responses to the physical parameters as well as making a fequency analysis. 

We made a test in a lab with a laser to mesure the position of the levitating magnet to be able to validate the modle.
A detailed explanation is in the explanaition pptx file
the main project is in 'Proyecto_Vibratoria_Principal' if u want to run it
